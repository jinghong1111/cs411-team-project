As a fourth-year college student who is bombarded with loans, debts, and a rather workaholic future, the least I can ask for is good mornings
to start my days. I couldn’t be bothered to make my own coffee in the morning as I am still debugging my problem set code that was due the
night before with my fingers crossed. I need my fix of caffeine fast, quick, and straight into my blood system, or else I will not make it. 
I’m not looking for anything too fancy, I just want caffeine. I found this pretty dope website named I’m Not Latte and it looks like it does 
exactly what I need it to. There’s a large search bar for drinks with a drop box which I pretty much just ignored, except for the “closest”
and “fastest” options. I searched for  a quick order of regular large and immediately, it returned the closest, fastest coffee shop: Dunkin
Donuts. It’s exactly what I needed.
